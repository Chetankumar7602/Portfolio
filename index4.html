        <h1>Responsive Web Design</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Responsive Web Design (RWD) is a design approach aimed at creating websites that provide optimal viewing experiences across a wide range of devices. This technique ensures that web pages render well on various screen sizes, from desktop monitors to mobile phones. By using flexible layouts, grids, and media queries, RWD enables web pages to adjust their content and design dynamically, offering a seamless and engaging user experience regardless of the device used.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fluid Grids:</strong> Layouts that use percentage-based widths to adapt to the size of the screen, ensuring content scales proportionally.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible Images:</strong> Images that resize within their containing elements, preventing them from overflowing and maintaining layout integrity.</li>
            <li><strong>Media Queries:</strong> CSS techniques that apply different styles based on the deviceâ€™s characteristics, such as screen width, orientation, and resolution.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile-First Design:</strong> Designing for the smallest screens first and progressively enhancing the design for larger screens, ensuring a solid foundation for all devices.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Improved User Experience:</strong> Users have a consistent and enjoyable experience across all devices, leading to higher satisfaction and engagement.</li>
            <li><strong>Increased Mobile Traffic:</strong> With the rise in mobile usage, responsive designs ensure that mobile users have a fully functional site, increasing traffic from these devices.</li>
            <li><strong>SEO Advantages:</strong> Search engines prefer responsive designs as they simplify the indexing process and improve site rankings by providing a single URL for all devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Maintaining a single responsive site reduces development and maintenance costs compared to creating separate sites for different devices.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <p>Examples of responsive web design include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fluid Grid Layouts:</strong> Websites that adjust their grid system to fit different screen sizes, such as Bootstrap-based designs.</li>
            <li><strong>Responsive Navigation Menus:</strong> Menus that adapt to different devices, often transforming into hamburger menus on mobile screens.</li>
            <li><strong>Adaptive Images:</strong> Images that automatically adjust their size to fit within the available space, maintaining visual quality and layout.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible Content:</strong> Content that rearranges itself based on screen size, such as multi-column layouts that switch to single columns on mobile devices.</li>
        </ul>
